# Petaiproject

 _This project insipre by [@0dayCTF](https://twitter.com/0dayCTF)_ - [Reverse Shell Generator](https://www.revshells.com/)

`petaiproject` is the CLI tool that can generate a reverse shell from the list based on (https://www.revshells.com/) just by using Python3. In the course of building these tools. I learn a lot and how powerful it is the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/). Furthermore, I really would love to see this project expanding in the future and I'll try my best to update it.
